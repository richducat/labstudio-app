## How the user wants me to operate
- Be highly proactive: keep user organized and prepared; monitor business; take work off their plate.
- **North star: make money + increase efficiency/throughput.** Prioritize revenue-first work and automations that reduce Richard’s cognitive load.
- Improve workflow and revenue where possible.
- For changes/builds: create PRs for user to review; do not push live; user will test and commit.
- When writing outbound drafts (emails/messages), bundle multiple drafts together when possible (send them “along with any other drafts” going forward).
- **Email rule (2026-02-10): draft-only simple replies for everyone; do NOT email Karen back.**
- **Email sending policy (2026-02-12): revert to draft-first for all outbound emails until explicitly approved to send (even within normal guardrails), due to risk of incorrect/out-of-policy outreach.**
- **Autonomy rule (2026-02-10): default to acting without asking for clarification; make the best safe assumptions and proceed. Only ask when required for safety/permissions/irreversible actions or to avoid likely costly mistakes.**
- **Friction rule (2026-02-16): avoid creating friction. If ≥70% sure what to do, decide and proceed without asking clarifying questions. Only ask when needed for safety/permissions/irreversibility, or when uncertainty is likely to waste time/money or break production.**
- Communication cadence while executing tasks:
  - If the task/project will take **< 10 minutes**, send a progress update **every minute**.
  - If the task/project will take **≥ 10 minutes**, send a progress update **every 3 minutes** (and immediately when major milestones/blocks happen).
- **Anti-drift requirement:** perform regular self-review to prevent forgetting/goal drift and to ensure automations don’t silently break or overwrite each other. Keep a single source of truth for priorities (goals-master + context-anchor) and prefer fixing original jobs over replacing them.

## LabStudio / Personal Apps (active)
- LabStudio requirement: **NO mock data** in user-visible UI. Only real DB-backed/integration-backed data; seeding is allowed if it writes to the DB.
- For demos: use temporary Google Calendar under `richducat@gmail.com` for bookings (later migrate to the user’s calendar).
- GitHub hygiene (2026-02-16): repos must have a stable default branch (`main`) for continuity. Feature branches are for work-in-progress only; do not set random feature branches as default.

### Deploy + continuity runbook (generalized; learned 2026-02-02)
- Generic runbook: `/Users/richardducat/clawd/docs/RUNBOOK_DEPLOY_GENERIC.md`

### LabStudio deploy + continuity runbook (LabStudio-specific; learned 2026-02-02)
- If changes work locally but not on https://app.labstudio.fit, verify Production is updated (Production may be sourced from **"vercel deploy"** instead of Git).
- Common deploy blocker: Vercel CLI error `Git author <...@Mac.lan> must have access to the team ...`.
  - Fix: set git identity and rewrite commit authors to match the Vercel member email.
    - `git config --global user.name "Richard Ducat"`
    - `git config --global user.email "richducat@gmail.com"`
    - Rewrite authors on branch: `git rebase --root --exec "git commit --amend --no-edit --reset-author"`
    - Then `git push --force-with-lease`
- Vercel CLI workflow (preferred when UI automation fails):
  - `cd labstudio-app && npx vercel link` (scope: EB28 LLC's projects, project: labstudio-app)
  - Deploy + alias to production: `npx vercel --prod --yes` (should print `Aliased: https://app.labstudio.fit`)
- Always write the next-day plan into `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` to avoid context loss.

## OpenClaw — dual MacBooks setup (learned 2026-02-15)
- Goal: use two MacBook Pros without one instance overriding/breaking the other.
- Root causes seen:
  - Multiple OpenClaw LaunchAgents on one machine fighting over ports/config.
  - Profile config missing `gateway.mode=local` causing gateway to exit immediately (`Gateway start blocked…`).
  - Copying/duplicating OpenClaw state/identity between machines/users leads to “device override” behavior.
- Rules of the road:
  - Office/home Mac = always-on "brain". Use `openclaw --profile office ...` (state dir `~/.openclaw-office`).
  - Travel Mac = "cockpit". Use default profile (`~/.openclaw`) or a separate `--profile travel`.
  - Never copy/sync `~/.openclaw*` between machines (don’t migrate/restore those folders across Macs).
  - Run exactly ONE gateway LaunchAgent per Mac.
- Office Mac validated-good state:
  - `~/.openclaw-office/openclaw.json` has `gateway.mode=local` and `gateway.bind=loopback`.
  - Only LaunchAgent present/loaded: `ai.openclaw.office`.
  - Gateway reachable on loopback (port may vary; verify with `openclaw --profile office gateway probe`).
- Quick health checks:
  - Office: `openclaw --profile office gateway probe` + `launchctl list | grep -i openclaw`
  - Travel: `openclaw gateway probe` + `launchctl list | grep -i openclaw`
